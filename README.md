# First-Website-Built
The very first website Daniel built from the ground up. With <!doctype html> omitted from the files.

So this is the first website I built from the ground up. It took me an entire day, single day, to finish the webpage.
Then the day after that, I added some effects and polished it a bit more so I can finally upload it here on github.
